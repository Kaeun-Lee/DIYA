※ Vector
- Array of numbers
 
※ Scalar operations
- Involve a vector and a number
- Addition/subtraction/multiplication/division

※ Vector addition/subtraction
- Two vectors must have same dimension
- Element-wise operation
- vector dimension : the number of items in a vector
 
※ ★ Dot product (벡터 내적 연산)
- Two vectors involved
- Result is a scalar

※ Matrices
- Rectangular grid of numbers (like a spreadsheet)

※ Matrix diemsions
- Dimension indicated by # rows and columns

※ Row and column vectors (벡터로 표현될 수 있는 matrix) 
- Row vector = (1, n) matrix
- Column vector = (n, 1) matrix

※ Matrix transposition
- Switch rows and columns

※ Scalar operations
- Addition/subtraction/multiplication/division of vector with a number

※ Matrix addition/subtraction
- Matrices must have same dimension
- Element-wise operation

※ ★ Matrix multiplication
- # of columns of the 1st matrix must be equal # of rows of the 2nd
- Product of an (m,n) matrix and an (n,k) matrix is an (m,k) matrix
