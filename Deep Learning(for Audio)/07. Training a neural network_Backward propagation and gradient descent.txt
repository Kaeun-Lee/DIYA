※ Training a neural network
- Tweak weights of the connections
- Feed training data (input + target) to the network
- Iterative adjustments

※ Training a neural network
- Input signals →
1. Get prediction
2. Calculate error

- Error signals ← (back to the initial layers)
3. Calculate gradient of error function over the weights
4. Update parameters

※ Calculate error
E = E(p, y) = 1/2(p - y)^2

※ Calculate gradient of error function
F = F(x, W)
E = E(p, y) = E(F(x, W), y)
 
※ Back propagation

※ Gradient descent
- Take a step in opposite direction to gradient
- Step = Learning rate
