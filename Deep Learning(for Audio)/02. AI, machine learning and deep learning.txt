▼ What you'll learn
- Defining AI
- What's machine learning?
- Supervised, and reinforcement learning
- Defining deep learning
- Traditional machine learning vs deep learning
- Deep learning applications in audio

※ Artificial intelligence > Machine learning > Deep learning

※ Intelligent agent = Rational agent 
- Rationality = Acting to achieve one's goals, given one's beliefs

※ Artificial intelligence
- Many AI techniques/algorithms
- Evolutionary algorithms
- Expert systems
- Search(e.g.,A*)
- Machine learning

※ Machine learning (ML)
- Computer performs a task without using explicit instructions
- Computer learns from data

※ Expert system: Onset detection / RULES -> 기계 -> 특징(패턴) 추출
※ ML onset detection: Training / 데이터 -> 기계 -> RULES

※ ML paradigms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- ...

※ Supervised learning
- Model trained with 'labelled' data

※ Unsupervised learning
- Model draws inferences from unstructured data

※ Reinforcement learning
- Agent takes actions in virtual environment and learns through rewards

※ ML algorithms
- Logistic regression
- Linear regression
- Random forest
- KNN
- Support vector machines
- Neural network(NN)
- ...

※ Neural network(NN) - 머신러닝에 속하고, 딥러닝을 사용
- Input layer -> Hidden layers -> Output layer

※ Deep learning
- ML subset
- (Deep) neural networks
- >1 hidden layer(more than 1)

※ Tranditional ML vs DL
- Feature engineering vs end-to-end
  - Feature engineering : labled된 데이터에서 featrues를 추출하고 이 features를 기계에 넣음(트레이닝)-> RULES
                                 특정 문제를 묘사하기위해 어떤 features가 가장 중요한지 이해하는 것이 가장 중요
  - End-to-end : row date를 어떠한 특징 추출도 없이 바로 머신러닝 알고리즘에 넘긴다. 
- (Relatively) small dataset vs large dateset
- Less computation intensive vs very resource intensive
- Ideal for "simple" problems vs ideal for "complex" problems

※ When should you use DL?
- Very large dataset
- Complex problem where traditional ML fails
- Access to extensive computational resources 

※ DL applications in audio
- Speech recognition
- Voice-based emotion classification
- Noise recognition
- Musical genre, instrument, mood classification
- Music tagging
- Music generation

 ※ Takeaway points
- AI = Building rational agents that act to achieve their goals given their beliefs
- ML is a subset of AI
- There are different flavours of ML and many ML algorithms
- DL is a subset of ML using DNNs
- DL isn't always the way to go!
