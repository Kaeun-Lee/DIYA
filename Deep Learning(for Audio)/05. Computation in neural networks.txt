▼ Why is a neural network needed?
- A single neuron works for linear problems
- Real-world problems are complex
- ANNs can reproduce highly non-linear functions


※ The components of an artificial nueral network (ANN)
- Neurons
- Input, hidden, output layers
- Weighted connections
- Activation function

※ The multilayer perceptron (MLP)
- Feed Forward Neural Network(FFNN)

※ Computaion in MLP
- Weights
- Net inputs (sum of weighted inputs)
- Activations (output of neurons to next layer)

※ Takeaway points
- ANNs work for complex problems 
  or problems that have nonlinear solutions
- Computation is distributed
- Signal moves from left to right
- Weights, net inputs and activations
