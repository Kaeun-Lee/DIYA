※ CNNs
- Mainly used for processing images
- 'Perform better' than multilayer perceptron
- 'Less parameters' than dense layers

※ Intuition
- Image data is structured
 - Edges, shapes
 - Translation invariance
 - Scale invariance
- CNN emulates human vision system
- Components of a CNN learn to extract different features

※ CNN components
- Convolution
- Pooling

※ Convolution
- Kernel = grid of weights
- Kernel is "applied" to the image
- Traditionally used in image processing

※ Convolution : Zero padding
- We come up with an artificial edge that has all zeros
  for the purpose of calculation

※ Kernels
- Feature detectors
- Kernels are learned

※ Architectural decisions for convolution
- Grid size
- Stride
- Depth
- Number of kernels

※ Grid size
- # of pixels for height/wieth
- Odd numbers

※ Stride
- Step size used for sliding kernel on image
- Indicated in pixels
- 가로 방향과 세로 방향의 stride를 다르게 설정할 수 있음

※ Depth (=Channel)
- Color image일 경우 kernel의 depth는 3이 된다. (R,G,B)

※ # of kernels
- A conv layer has multiple kernels
- Each kernel outputs a single 2D array
- Output from a layer has as many 2d arrays as # kernels

※ Pooling
- Downsample the image
- Overlaying grid on image
- Max/average pooling
- No parameters

※ Pooling settings
- Grid size
- Stride
- Type (e.g., max, average)

※ CNN architecture

           ┌━━━━━━━━━━ Feature Learning ━━━━━━━━━━┐    ┌━━━━━ Classification ━━━━━┐
Input -> Convolution + Relu -> Pooling -> Convolution + Relu -> Pooling -> Flatten -> Fully Connected -> Softmax

- 앞단의 Conv layer에서는 low-level features를 추출 (ex. edges)
- layer가 깊어질수록 higher-level features를 추출 (ex. shapes -> objects (like a car))

※ How does convolution/pooling apply to audio?
- Spectrogram/MFCC = image
- Time, frequency      = x, y
- Amplitude 	    = pixel value

※ Preparing MFCCs for a CNN
- 13 MFCCs
- Hop length                = 512 samples
- # samples in audio file = 51,200
-> Data shape = 100 x 13 x 1 (1 = Depth)
 - audio data는 grayscale image와 비교되기 때문에 RGB는 필요없음
