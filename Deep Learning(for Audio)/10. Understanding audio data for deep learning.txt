※ Sound
- Produced by the vibration of an object
- Vibrations determine oscillation of air molecules
- Alternation of air pressure causes a wave

※ Waveform
- period
 - period is strictly correlated with frequency
 - frequency is the inverse of period
  - f =1 / T

- amplitude
 - the distance of a point from zero

※ Frequency/pitch and amplitude/loudness

※ Analog digital conversion (ADC)
- Sample rate = 44,100 Hz
- Bit depth = 16bits/channel

Step 1. Sampling
- Signal sampled at uniform time intervals

Step 2. Qauntization
- Amplitude quantised with limited number of bits

※ Fourier tansform
- Decompose complex periodic sound into sum of sine waves oscillating at different frequencies
- From time domain to frequency domain
- No time imformation 
 
※ Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
- Computes several FFT at different intervals
- Preserves time imformation
- Fixed frame size (e.g., 2048 samples)
 - frame : a bunch of samples
- Gives a spectrogram (time + frequency + magnitude)

※ DL pre-processing pipeline for audio data

※ Tranditional ML pre-processing pipeline for audio data
a waveform -> Amplitude envelope, Spectral centroid, 0-crssing rate, Spectral flux, ... -> ML algorithm
- Feature engineering
- Perform STFT
- Extract time + frequency domain features

※ Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
- Capture timbral/textural aspects of sound
- Frequency domain feature
- Approximate human auditory system
- 13 to 40 coefficients
- Calculated at each frame

※ MFCCs applications
- Speech recognition
- Music genre classification
- Music instrument classification
